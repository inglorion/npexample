Example NPAPI browser plugin.

Prerequisites:

* Some sane build environment. You will need a C compiler and Make.

* You need to have the NPAPI header files in your C include path.
  You can download them from https://github.com/isis-project/npapi-headers


To build:

* Run make. If all goes well, this will create a file named npexample.so.


To install:

* Put npexample.so in your browser's plugins directory, e.g. for Mozilla
  browsers, cp npexample.so $HOME/.mozilla/plugins/


To see it in action:

* Open test.html in your web browser.
